# Covid-19-Diagnosis-Application
Since 2019, the coronavirus has engendered loss and confusion throughout the world, and even as COVID
cases drop down in the United States in 2021, places such as India still suffer from coronavirus and its
variant. For many people, they continue to experience constant stress from the uncertainty of the future,
and particularly in countries still facing the coronavirus, medical professionals face the difficult decision
on whether to allow patients use of hospital facilities, ventilators, or the intensive care unit (ICU). This
paper explores time series methodologies that would help forecast the current trend of cases in the United
States, which we hope to expand to other countries and COVID variants. As of May 11, 2021, this paper
forecasts an exponential decrease in COVID-19 cases in the U.S. throughout the summer. Furthermore,
the paper finds logistic regression and support vector machines as the best models in classifying whether a
particular patient would need hospitalization, ventilation, the ICU, and potentially, end-of-life care. Holistically, our paper works as the back-end documentation, particularly on the classification methods, for
our accompanied Shiny app, which we made available to the public (https://rlsimpao.shinyapps.io/cdcfinal/? ga=2.22230386.897110583.1623115674-205289261.1623115674).

This report aims to replicate the ideas presented in the paper,“Personalized Predictive Models for Symptomatic COVID-19 Patients Using Basic Preconditions” by Wollenstein-Betech, Cassandras, and Paschalidis.
